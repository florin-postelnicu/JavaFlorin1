Here is the doc for using vectors(or ArrayList)

The way the things are wprking here:

HangmanJ6 is the Commnd Center. This is the one withs a psvm function , 
that should be run.

HangmanJ4  is the main engine of the game. In this class it is solved the algorithm for hangman.

SelectWord class  gets a random word from a CSV file listofwords.csv,
but, it doesn't call directly the text file, it calss a new class:

ConvertArrayList. This class reads a file csv, and converts thelist of words into an ArrayList.
ArrayList is used because of the dynamic aloccation of the memory.

The text file listofwords.scv needs to be refferd through its path. Easier is to just 
copy the path of the file in the call :
scanner = new Scanner(new File("C:\\Users\\postelnicu\\IdeaProjects\\FlorinJavaProject\\src\\JavaFlorin01\\src\\listofwordsj.csv"));
