Static method: 

A method declared with the static keyword. Like static fields, static methods are associated with the class 

itself, not with any particular object created from the class. As a result, you don’t have to create an object from a class

before you can use static methods defined by the class.

The best-known static method is main, which is called by the Java runtime to start an application. The main method must be

static, which means that applications run in a static context by default.

One of the basic rules of working with static methods is that you can’t access a nonstatic method or field from a static method 

because the static method doesn’t have an instance of the class to use to reference instance methods or fields.
